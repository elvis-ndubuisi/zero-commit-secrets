# 🔑 Zero-Commit Secrets

**Developer-first secrets management** — secure, self-hostable, and open-source. Keep secrets out of Git.
Make onboarding/offboarding less painful. _A small side project turned open-source playground_

## What is this?

Zero-Commit Secret is me experimenting with:

- Secrets management (but lighter + simpler).
- Playing with new languages + tools (Node.js, maybe Go or Rust later).
- Running an OSS project like a “real” product (issues, PRs, CI/CD, docs, the whole thing).

This **isn’t** meant to replace [Doppler](https://www.doppler.com/), [Infisical](https://infisical.com/), or 
[Vault](https://www.hashicorp.com/en/products/vault).
It’s more like… _training wheels for me as a project maintainer_ + a playground for anyone else curious.


## Goal (Bring your Idea)
- Eliminate the use of _.env_ and fetch secrets via a simple CLI.
- Pre-commit hook to stop secrets leaks.
- Audit logs for “who did what.”
- Dashboard UI for managing secrets.
- Self-hostable version
- A hosted SaaS version with billing.

## Contributing

You don’t have to be an expert. In fact, this project is friendly to:
- Curious devs who want to dip into open source.
- Folks learning GitHub Projects, Issues, CI/CD, etc.
- People who just want to throw in an idea, feedback, or even a typo fix.

> PRs, Issues, and random ideas are welcome.
> Even if it’s just: “hey, you spelled secrettt wrong.”
